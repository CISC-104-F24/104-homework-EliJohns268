         * I guess a question I have is how one would go about coding Grappling Hook physics.
         * This relates to my game idea.
         * The idea is a movement based shooter either pvp based or just a single-player target shooting course type game, or both. The Grappling physics would be similar to thoses in the Anime attack on titan if you've seen that.
